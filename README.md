# Using-ARIMA-Model-to-Forecast-Sales-of-an-Automobile-Company-
When it comes to running businesses successfully, sales forecasting is a crucial component to include in the process. In this Project, the aim is to forecast the sales made by a car manufacturing company in a particular city. The data outlines the total sales of the company manufactured cars at the end of the month from 2016 to 2018. Utilizing this data, we fit the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time series with the regression model. We identify the best fit ARIMA model and use this to obtain the sales forecast for the subsequent year. The Model is compared with other time series forecasting models for. To successfully build the model we use Python Programming.
